Steps to run docker on windows.

1. Open Windows powershell as admin
	Once the powershell is open, you need to get in to WSL
2. use command "wsl --install" to get into Ubuntu
3. In WSL you need to clone the vitis ai repo from GitHub. use chatgpt to clone the repo.
4. After cloning the repo, you should be able to see the Vitis-ai directory inside wsl.
5. You are going to need to create a directory called test folder using "mkdir test-folder"
6. Give the folder permissions to copy from your host laptop or pc using this command "sudo chown cruzh3r:cruzh3r ~/test-folder"
7. Once that is done you are going to copy your model from downloads folder into that directory using this command "cp /mnt/c/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Downloads/modified_scnn-vs-enet-vs-enet-sad-on-tusimple-dataset.ipynb ~/test-folder/".
8. Next, you are going to run docker by mounting your downloads folder to the docker using this command "docker run --rm -it -v ~/test-folder:/mnt/downloads xilinx/vitis-ai-cpu:latest /bin/bash".
9. After this step, you should be inside vitis ai.
10. change directory using this folder "cd /mnt/downloads".
11. check if the model is present in the folder.
12. Now you can copy the model into another folder if need be using this command "cp modified_scnn-vs-enet-vs-enet-sad-on-tusimple-dataset.ipynb /home/vitis-ai-user/".
13. next you are going to install notebook inside the docker using this command "pip3 install notebook". 
14. open a new windows powershell as admin
15. Run this command "docker ps". This will give you the docker container ID.
16. Saved the customised docker image using this command "docker commit <container_id> lanenet-vitis-ai-pytorch"
